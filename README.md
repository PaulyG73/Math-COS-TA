# Math-COS-TA
# This is a bash script intended to compile multiple c++ source code files (.cpp files) and, afterwards, run them sequentially.
The script uses the g++ compiler to compile the code.
The user will be prompted to enter an "input file." This file contains any input data necessary to run the executables, and must be created by the user prior to running the script.
The results from the executables after running will be written to a file titled, "output_execute.txt" which will be created by the script.
